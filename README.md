# NDK Ports Guide

This repository was forked from [the official NDK Ports repository](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/ndkports/+/refs/heads/main). It provides instructions and tools for building ports with the Android NDK.

## Building a Port

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   Ensure you have all necessary dependencies and your environment is set up for building.

2. **Run the Build Script**:
   Execute the build script by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_release.sh
   ```
